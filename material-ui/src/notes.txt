things you can use the library for:

- import { Paper } from '@material-ui/core';

// Paper component is one that will give a nice 
background and potentially some elevation to a component.

- import { Card, CardContent } from '@material-ui/core';
...
<Card>
    <CardContent>
        <h1>This is content within my card</h1>
    </CardContent>
</Card>

// You may want to use a card as well

- import { Button } from '@material-ui/core';

// Material-UI has very nice looking buttons as well. 
It is as simple as importing it and implementing it

forms as well. We can do something simple
